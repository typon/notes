Why coding streams/shows are interesting to me: in some livestreams, the experience is very similar to pair programming, 
but those people are experts. In VODs, it's more about problem solving and learning skills and approaches. The devs are really good
at what they do and there is *always* a lot to learn.

In no particular order:

1) Handmade Hero
About the author: Casey Muratori. Worked at RAD.
Description and why I like it: It kinda started the whole thing for me. Casey is coding a complete game and engine on stream, 
from scratch, one hour a day. He knows what he's doing on so many of the domains of game development and regular programing, 
that you can't not learn something new every episode. Strongly dislikes OOP, the c++ committee, and microsoft ;) so maybe not 
suitable for fans of those. This show has also spurred a complete community about "handmade" development, inspiring other developers
to take up streaming and so on. Noteworthy is Casey talks about his thought process and what he's doing non-stop (so no interacting
with the audience until the Q&A) sometimes drawing diagrams/pieces of art to explain things, etc -- which is somewhat different from 
the other streams, which can have both more silences and pauses, to check the chat, answer questions and so on.
Language: mostly C with a bit of C++
Tools: emacs and then 4coder for editing, msvc for debugging
Livestreams: https://www.twitch.tv/handmade_hero "every" weekday
VODs: https://www.youtube.com/user/handmadeheroarchive/videos
Backlog: around 290+ episodes of one-hour (usually; with some additional time for Q&A afterwards)
Twitter: https://twitter.com/handmade_hero & https://twitter.com/cmuratori
Note about annotated episodes: since it's a popular show, there are members of the community who annotate parts of the episodes, 
like a timestamped log of what Casey is doing, Q&A, etc. https://hero.handmade.network/episodes

2) Nothings
About the author: Sean Barrett. Works at RAD. stb libraries, sparse virtual textures, ... -- a legend.
Description and why I like it: Sometimes streams about STB work, but it's mostly about OBBG, a block building game project based
on his stb voxel renderer (Ã  la Minecraft + Factorio). Such an expert coder that I think it could be hard to follow for beginners.
Language: C 
Tools: VC6 with limited syntax highlighting
Livestreams: https://www.twitch.tv/nothings2 with no specific schedule
VODs: https://www.youtube.com/user/silverspaceship/videos
Backlog: around 50 episodes of variable length (usually 2-hour+ long)
Twitter: https://twitter.com/nothings

3) Per Vognsen
About the author: I *think* Per worked at RAD (notice a pattern here ? :) and Epic, and is now at Oculus.
Description and why I like it: Started streaming pretty recently, so a short backlog, but it's *so good*. It's not about a specific
projet per-se, there have been streams about data structures, coding a text editor, a profiler, a compiler, etc but I think one
the main themes is going to be "building a compiler from scratch" (there have been 3 episodes on this topic already), as Per seems
to enjoy the subject and is very knowledgeable and skilled about it and more.
Language: C/C++ (Python once)
Tools: a recent Visual Studio
Livestreams: https://www.twitch.tv/vognsen with no specific schedule, most have been during the weekend
VODs: https://www.youtube.com/user/pervognsen/videos
Backlog: 15 eps or so, most are around 2 hours, but some last 5 or 6 hours.

4) Ferris streams stuff
About the author: Jake Taylor. Demo scene + emulator experience :D
Description and why I like it: An N64 emulator in Rust. N64. Emulator. In Rust. Streams mostly from the Bay Area, but sometimes
Norway, when Europeans like myself can catch it live more easily. Not tied to this project per se, once or twice streamed about
other things (no demo stuff yet, you have to keep those secrets from the competing teams ;)
Language: mostly Rust (Elm once).
Tools: emacs
Livestreams: https://www.twitch.tv/ferrisstreamsstuff no specific schedule, usually saturdays
VODs: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4mpLlHn0FOekNg05yCnkzQ/videos
Backlog: 10 episodes, 2 to 3 hours long
Twitter: https://twitter.com/ferristweetsnow

5) Seantheprogrammer
About the author: Sean Griffin, Rails core team member, maintainer of ActiveRecord (Rails' ORM)
Description and why I like it: Sean streams about his diesel project, a query builder and ORM in Rust. My general dislike of
ORMs didn't spoil my enjoyment of the query-building part, Rust coding and its type-system, and joking about long compile times
with Sean :) I think diesel is going to be the main project, but Sean describes his streams as "about open source work" so there
might be other topics in the future.
Language: Rust
Livestreams: https://www.twitch.tv/seantheprogrammer with no specific schedule thus far. But it seems there will be one, like tuesdays
and thursdays during the day (in Ottawa) and weekends. (The new schedule makes me think topics other than Diesel could come up sooner
rather than later)
VODs: https://www.youtube.com/user/ferret4prez/videos
Backlog: around 7 episodes, lasting between 1h30 and 3 hours
Twitter: https://twitter.com/sgrif

6) naysayer88 
About the author: Game developer Jonathan Blow
Description and why I like it: A bit different from the other shows. Jon develops a programming language for games, mostly offline, 
and demos stuff he's worked on periodically. A couple times he's streamed porting some C++ to the new language.
Language: C/C++, "JAI"
Livestreams: https://www.twitch.tv/naysayer88 with no schedule
VODs: https://www.youtube.com/user/jblow888/videos
Backlog: 30+ episodes, lasting between 1 and 2 hours usually.
Twitter: https://twitter.com/Jonathan_Blow

7) Quel Solaar
About the author: Game developer Eskil Steenberg
Description and why I like it: varied topics, as Eskil has a billion projects going on, ranging from game dev, game tools, regular 
tools, working on libraries, ...,  and more.
Language: C
Livestreams: https://www.twitch.tv/quel_solaar with no schedule
VODs: Apparently none apart from the ones Twitch provides, which usually last only a couple weeks. Yep :(
Twitter: https://twitter.com/quelsolaar

Also noteworthy, even though I'm less familiar with them:
8) ssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssmcgrath
About the author: Game developer Shawn McGrath
Description and why I like it: Sporadic, but varied but most are about work on Shawn's in-progress MOBA game. Copious profanity :)
Language: C/C++
Livestreams: https://www.twitch.tv/sssmcgrath with no schedule
VODs: early episodes https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXom8XPAKOUdxF6LJB-p_ag/videos
      recent episodes https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCaGgN8bSSJmlXxyKh2CFzA/videos
Backlog: early episodes - around 20+ eps, lasting 2-3 hours each.
         recent episodes - 55 eps, still lasting 2-3 hours each.

9) Mr4thDimension
About the author: Allen Webster, student :) One of the Handmade Hero "spinoffs" I mentioned earlier.
Description and why I like it: So far it has mostly been about streaming workin on 4coder, a text editor for code, which Casey 
uses in Handmade Hero. Obviously mostly about topics you'd encounter in coding a text editor for developers!
Language: C/C++
Livestreams: https://www.twitch.tv/mr4thdimention usually wednesdays. Probably more during the summer holidays.
VODs: https://www.youtube.com/user/Mr4thdimention/videos
Backlog: dozens of 1h30-2h episodes.
Twitter: https://twitter.com/allenwebster4th

I have to mention 2 related things: First, the twitch creative section https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Creative/all where a lot
of people stream programming, game dev and so on. And secondly, http://www.watchpeoplecode.com/ and https://www.livecoding.tv/ which
both do what it says on the tin :)

And to conclude I'll also briefly mention a couple other ones I enjoy:
- William Chyr working on Manifold Garden https://www.twitch.tv/williamchyr and https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3E8GOTzV5gf_JaIa95I7gw/videos
- Quill18's fun Unity projects/tutorials https://www.youtube.com/user/quill18creates/videos
- Dan Abramov working on React https://www.twitch.tv/gaearon
